Repository contains assignments that were made mainly with PyTorch, during taking part in course led by Karol Majek from Deep Drive PL. The Programme consists of several modules:
* Image Representation
* Basic Neural Netowrks for image classification
* Convolutional Neural Networks
* Data Augmentation
* Hyperparameter optimization
* Model results analysis
* Self supervised learning
* Model optimization
* Model serving
